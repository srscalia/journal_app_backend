# Journaling App (Backend)

**Demo**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rew72U8tiRs

A safe place for your thoughts. An online journaling app. 

Users log in or sign up to create account with the app. Users create different themed journals where they can add entries with or without media. Users can view photos from each journal or all journals in the photo gallery feature. 

## Getting Started

This is the backend repository for this project. To run this app on your local machine you must have the frontend and backend repos. For frontend instructions, see [README.md](https://github.com/srscalia/journal_app_fronten). For backend instructions, see the following:

1. Clone this repo down to your local machine. 
2. In the repository, run `rails db:create && rails db:migrate`. 
3. Run `rails s`.
  
These instructions will get you a copy of the backend for the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes. Both the backend and frontend will need to be running for this software to work.

### Prerequisites
